Health Monitor is a simulation of a monitor generating patient's temperature and bp values. Here I am generating random values.

Frontend is built using Angular, HTML and CSS.

Backend is built using Springboot and Java.

API calls are used to start and stop streaming the values.

Websockets are used to continuously pass values from backend to frontend.

Junit test cases and BDD scenarios for backend is also done with 100% code coverage.

Also containerized frontend and backend separately using docker.
